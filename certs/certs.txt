certs directory
cd to this directory and
create private key and name it as private.pem:
   on mac -> openssl genrsa -out private.pem 3072 (at least 2048 bits key) - not working anymore
          -> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -m PEM -f private.pem - WORKING!!!!
   on windows -> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b "3072"
